  `02_clean-data.py`) and functions in `/code/src`.
- `/data` project data sets.
- `/figures` PNG images and plots.
- `/presentations` Presentation slides.
- `.gitignore` Hidden Git instructions file.
- `.python-version` Hidden Python version for the reproducible
  environment.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory
```
cd project-name
```
3. Run the following to create the `/.venv` project library and install the specified library versions.
```
python -m venv .venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: Whenever you install new libraries or decide to update the versions of
libraries you use, run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to update
`requirements.txt`.
4. Run the main script
```
python main.py
```
